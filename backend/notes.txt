req ==> to get data
res ==> to send data


we have 3 types of files :
1. in controller folder
2. in route folder
3. in model folder


the files in model folder is to create the schema.
the files in route folder is to crete router using "express" and to send and get data 
the files in controller use model files and create functions, then send this functions to router file to use in "app.js" file.
